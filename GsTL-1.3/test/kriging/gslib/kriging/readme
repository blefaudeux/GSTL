GSLIB results (KT3D program)
-----------------------------------

The kriging algorithms were tested on the parta.dat data set using KT3D.
For kriging with trend, the kriging type to be chosen is OK (flag=1).
If you want to do plain OK, don't forget to set all the drift flags to 0 !
SK_kt3d.par, OK_kt3d.par, KT_kt3d.par are the parameter files for simple kriging,
ordinary kriging and kriging with trend. 
The corresponding kriging matrices, weights and estimates are in files SK_kt3d.dbg,
OK_kt3d.dbg, KT_kt3d.dbg.


Note about kt3d.dbg:
--------------------
In kriging with a trend, the matrix coefficient Fk(u) are scaled.
Hence the corresponding lines of the kriging matrix differ from 
the results output by test4.cc.
